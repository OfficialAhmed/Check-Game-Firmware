# Check Game Firmware (CGFw) 
Ever wondered which firmware a PS4 game requires? well this tool is for you.

### *Download Latest release:-*
##### https://github.com/OfficialAhmed/Check-Game-Firmware/releases
### *Update Notes:-*

- **[Feature]** *Online mode is now available*. Google search engine used, thus requires user to be precise and accurate about game titles i.e.(*Type **fifa 22** instead of only **fifa***). No recommendations nor spelling check from CGFw all handled by Google. Only games available on PlayStation Store will be recognized.
- **[Fixed]** Doesn't cache Fw and keeps showing the default one
- **[Fixed]** Wrong Fw reading from offline Db
- **[Enhancement]** Removed alpha firmwares as well as fw starting with (1)
- **[Enhancement]** Mode will also be cached now on (Save and update changes button click)
- **[Enhancement]** No reload needed after (Save and update changes)
- **[Enhancement]** Minimized codes/repetitions + Changed different approaches to many problems

### *How it works*
This tool compares the game and the official firmware release dates then determine if a game is playable on selected firmware or not. This is not 100% accurate
but it's pretty decent as this is still WIP.

### *Built-in Offline Search engine*
Took over 500 lines of code to implement a basic search engine for the **offline mode** and here's how it may become useful whenever you search.

* Search all by release date

> For games released in 2020 **Search for 2020**

> For games released in November (Only type the first 3 letters of the month) **Search for Nov** 

* Search all by genre

> For all Adventure genre **Search for adventure** 

> For all Action genre **Search for action** 

* Search all DLCs

> For all DLCs **Search for dlc** 

* Search by Game ID (WIP, not all IDs are available)

> For Final Fantasy VII Remake **Search for cusa07187** or **Search for cusa16170**

### *Noobs Tutorial:-*
* Download ZIP file from the provided link and extract the file
* Always run exe as administrator
* Pick the desired firmware from top left hand corner
* type the Game Title then search

* Red results Meaning: Game isn't supported by the firmware you picked (0-5% chance)
* Orange results Meaning: Game may or may not be supported (20-40% chance)
* Green results Meaning: Game is most probably (80-95% chance) supported by the firmware
