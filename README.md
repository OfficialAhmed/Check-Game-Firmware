# Details
This tool compares the game and the official firmware release dates then determine if a game is playable on that selected firmware or not. This is not 100% accurate
but it's pretty decent as this is still WIP.

I will be improving this project ***(This is not the final version)***.

# Built-in Search engine
Took me over 500 lines of code and 48+ hours to implement a basic search engine for the offline mode and here's how it may become useful whenever you search.

* Search all by release date

> For games released in 2020 **Search for 2020**

> For games released in November (Only type the first 3 letters of the month) **Search for Nov** 

* Search all by genre

> For all Adventure genre **Search for adventure** 

> For all Action genre **Search for action** 

* Search all DLCs

> For all DLCs **Search for dlc** 

* Search by Game ID (WIP, not all IDs are available)

> For Final Fantasy VII Remake **Search for cusa07187** or **Search for cusa16170**
